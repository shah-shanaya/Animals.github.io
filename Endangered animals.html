<p>TURTELS:
Turtles are reptiles of the order Testudines, also known as Chelonia. They are characterized by a bony or cartilaginous shell, developed from their ribs, that acts as a shield. Testudines include both extant and extinct species. Its earliest known members date from the Middle Jurassic. All 7 species of marine turtles are listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). 3 are classified as critically endangered by IUCN and a further 3 are classified as endangered. Marine turtles appear to have the potential to reproduce abundantly: females can lay hundreds of eggs in one nesting season. But even under "natural" conditions, relatively few young turtles survive their first year of life.

Predators such as crabs, foxes, and birds often kill the hatchlings as they make their way from the nest to the sea, and when they reach the shallows, many more small turtles are taken by fish.</p>

<p>TIGERS:
The tiger is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. Sumatran tigers are critically endangered. There are fewer than 500 left in the wild. But the Leuser Ecosystem they call home is in trouble. This critical rainforest habitat is bulldozed to make room for palm oil plantations.
ELEPHANTS:
Elephants are a select group of proboscideans belonging to the family Elephantidae. They are the largest existing land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. Indonesia’s Sumatran Elephants are in trouble. Critically endangered, these majestic elephants could be wiped out if we don’t act soon. Massive industrial development for palm oil and paper plantations are destroying their habitat, 6.5 million acres of the Leuser Ecoystem. 

Conflict Palm Oil isn’t some far-away problem. It’s an ingredient found on our grocery store shelves — and probably in your own home.</p>
